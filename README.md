CONCEPTS
========

A timeline consists of the following:

- all time is on the Rational number plane Q
- time points are punctuated events on the timeline with 0 width - a single point
- spans of time are represented as "summaries" - they have a beginning and an end,
  and are only visible within a range of precision.
- viewing the timespan could be seen as a 2-dimensional pagination system:
  - left and right pagination is performed by the left and right bounds of the window
  - in and out pagination is done by "summarizing" the entries that are closer together
    than a specific "threshold" value.
  - the threshold value is in terms of the absolute timeline, where that value is
    derived by the current window, and the precision - a value between 0 and 1, exclusive.

| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--------- |
| Window | Current view of a timeline, bounded by a **left bound** and **right bound**, where **left bound <= right bound**. |
| Time Point | A single instance on the timeline on time Q |
| Summary | A defined human readable summary instance, with an optional **left bound** and **right bound** (at least one has to be defined), and an optional **min threshold** and **max threshold** (no definition requirements). It also has a **count** of items not being viewed currently (being summarized), and a **viewed** array of items currently being viewed that have been associated with this summary. |
| General Summary | A summary generated by the current window, not definted by anyone. This allows the user to see what isn't currently visible based on the current zoom level. It has a **left bound**, **right bound**, and **count** of items being summarized. |
| Threshold | A distance between points Q |
| Precision | A percentage of the window size, between 0 and 1 |

Questionable Ideas
------------------

1. Should a defined summary be summarized if its left and right bounds are lower than the threshold?
2. Should there be an option to ignore min / max thresholds for summaries, to know the context of the timeline?
   Say you're super zoomed in, inside a bunch of summaries that are past their min threshold, would it be helpful
   for a user to see what context they're inside? What about if a user is super zoomed out, where their threshold
   is larger than the max threshold - would it be useful to see all timespans in a timeline, even though summaries
   are only theoretically relevant to a zoom level?
