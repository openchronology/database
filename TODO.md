TODO
====

- Make the whole database aware of sessions - only allow users to see differences
  in what they're requesting (changing their zoom level, precision, or offset)

  - implies tracking multiple sessions per user, would have to be able to tell
    what changes in someone's view

- Provide breakpoints in summaries - the largest difference between points to let
  the summary break apart - the difference at which the threshold would have to
  be less than in order to break apart the summary.
